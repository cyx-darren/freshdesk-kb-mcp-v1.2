- **bug_attachments**: id, bug_report_id, file_url, file_name, file_size, file_type, uploaded_at

## Status Workflow
1. **New** - Initial status when bug is reported
2. **In Progress** - Admin is working on the issue
3. **Under Review** - Fix is being reviewed/tested
4. **Resolved** - Issue has been fixed
5. **Closed** - Issue is completely resolved and closed
