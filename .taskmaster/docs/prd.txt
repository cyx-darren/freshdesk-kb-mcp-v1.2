# Overview  
Freshdesk Knowledge Base MCP - A comprehensive knowledge management system built with React frontend, Node.js backend, and Supabase database. The system provides article management, AI-powered chat assistance, bug reporting, feature requests, and administrative tools. The project integrates with Playwright for testing and uses MCP (Model Context Protocol) for AI interactions.

Current state: The application has core functionality implemented but needs optimization, enhanced user experience, better performance, and additional enterprise features.

# Core Features  
- **Article Management System**: Create, edit, publish, and manage knowledge base articles with rich text editing
- **AI-Powered Chat**: Interactive chat interface with AI assistance and feedback collection
- **User Authentication**: Secure login/registration system with protected routes
- **Administrative Dashboard**: Admin tools for managing articles, users, feedback, bugs, and feature requests
- **Bug Reporting System**: Comprehensive bug tracking with file attachments and status management
- **Feature Request System**: User-driven feature requests with voting and priority management
- **Search & Discovery**: Article search with category filtering and SEO optimization
- **Feedback Collection**: User feedback system for AI responses and articles
- **Analytics & Reporting**: Usage analytics and performance metrics
- **Playwright Integration**: Automated testing capabilities

# User Experience  
Primary users include:
- **End Users**: Seeking information through articles and chat assistance
- **Content Creators**: Writing and managing knowledge base content
- **Administrators**: Managing the entire system and user feedback
- **Developers**: Maintaining and enhancing the platform

Key user flows need optimization for mobile responsiveness, loading performance, and intuitive navigation. The rich text editor experience should be enhanced for better content creation.

# Technical Architecture  
- **Frontend**: React 18 with Vite, TailwindCSS, React Router
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express, middleware for authentication
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) with real-time subscriptions
- **AI Integration**: Claude AI via MCP server, Playwright MCP for testing
- **File Storage**: Supabase storage for attachments
- **Deployment**: Railway platform with Docker containerization

Current architecture is solid but needs performance optimization, better error handling, and enhanced security measures.

# Development Roadmap  

## Phase 1: Performance & Optimization (MVP Enhancement)
- Implement lazy loading and code splitting for better performance
- Optimize database queries and implement caching strategies
- Enhance error handling and user feedback across all components
- Improve mobile responsiveness and accessibility compliance
- Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring

## Phase 2: User Experience Enhancement
- Redesign and optimize the rich text editor with better toolbar functionality
- Implement advanced search with full-text search and filters
- Add user preferences and customizable dashboards
- Enhance the chat interface with better conversation management
- Implement dark mode and theme customization

## Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Add real-time collaboration for article editing
- Implement advanced analytics dashboard with detailed insights
- Add export/import functionality for articles and data
- Implement advanced user roles and permissions system
- Add integration APIs for third-party tools

## Phase 4: Enterprise Features
- Implement multi-tenancy support
- Add advanced security features (2FA, audit logs)
- Implement workflow automation for content approval
- Add advanced reporting and business intelligence features
- Implement backup and disaster recovery systems

# Logical Dependency Chain
1. **Foundation**: Database optimization and caching (essential for all features)
2. **Performance**: Frontend optimization and lazy loading (improves user experience immediately)
3. **Core UX**: Enhanced rich text editor and search (directly impacts daily usage)
4. **User Management**: Advanced roles and permissions (enables team collaboration)
5. **Analytics**: Enhanced reporting and insights (provides business value)
6. **Advanced Features**: Real-time collaboration and integrations (adds competitive advantage)
7. **Enterprise**: Multi-tenancy and advanced security (enables scaling)

Each phase builds upon the previous, ensuring continuous value delivery while maintaining system stability.

# Risks and Mitigations  
- **Performance Risk**: Large articles and media files could impact load times
  - Mitigation: Implement progressive loading and CDN integration
- **Database Scaling**: Growing content and users may stress current database setup
  - Mitigation: Implement connection pooling and query optimization
- **Security Risk**: User-generated content and file uploads present security challenges
  - Mitigation: Implement comprehensive input validation and file scanning
- **Integration Complexity**: MCP integrations may become complex to maintain
  - Mitigation: Create abstraction layers and comprehensive testing

# Appendix  
- Current tech stack is modern and well-chosen
- Existing Playwright integration provides good testing foundation
- Supabase integration is well-implemented with real-time features
- Rich text editor has good foundation but needs enhancement
- Bug reporting and feature request systems are functional but could be more sophisticated
- Current deployment setup on Railway is appropriate for current scale
