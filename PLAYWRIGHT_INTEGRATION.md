  "url": "https://example.com",
  "duration": 30000
}
```

### Cleanup
```http
POST /api/playwright/cleanup
```

## Usage Examples

### 1. Knowledge Base Content Scraping
```javascript
// Extract content from a knowledge base article
const result = await playwrightService.extractContent(
  'https://support.example.com/article/123',
  '.article-content'
);
```

### 2. Automated Testing
```javascript
// Test a contact form
const result = await playwrightService.fillForm(
  'https://example.com/contact',
  {
    '#name': 'Test User',
    '#email': 'test@example.com',
    '#message': 'This is a test message'
  }
);
```

### 3. Documentation Generation
```javascript
// Generate PDF documentation
const result = await playwrightService.generatePDF(
  'https://docs.example.com/api',
  { format: 'A4', filename: 'api-docs.pdf' }
);
```

### 4. Visual Regression Testing
```javascript
// Capture screenshots for comparison
const result = await playwrightService.takeScreenshot(
  'https://app.example.com/dashboard',
  { fullPage: true, filename: 'dashboard-screenshot.png' }
);
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
The Playwright service uses the following configuration:

- **Headless Mode**: Runs in headless mode for production
- **Browser Args**: Includes sandbox flags for Railway deployment
- **Viewport**: Default 1280x720 resolution
- **User Agent**: Standard Chrome user agent

### Railway Deployment
The service is configured for Railway deployment with:
- `--no-sandbox` and `--disable-setuid-sandbox` flags
- Chromium browser pre-installed via `npx playwright install chromium`
- Proper cleanup on process termination

## Security Considerations

### 1. URL Validation
- Always validate URLs before processing
- Implement allowlists for trusted domains
- Sanitize user inputs

### 2. Resource Management
- Browser instances are automatically cleaned up
- Implement timeouts for long-running operations
- Monitor memory usage

### 3. File Handling
- Screenshots and PDFs are base64 encoded
- Optional file saving to secure directories
- Implement file size limits

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Browser Not Initialized**
   - Check if Chromium is installed: `npx playwright install chromium`
   - Verify sandbox flags for containerized environments

2. **Memory Issues**
   - Implement regular cleanup calls
   - Monitor browser instance count
   - Set appropriate timeouts

3. **Network Timeouts**
   - Increase timeout values for slow sites
   - Use appropriate wait conditions
   - Handle network errors gracefully

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by setting environment variables:
```bash
DEBUG=pw:* node server.js
```

## Integration with Cursor MCP

The Playwright MCP server is also available directly in Cursor for AI-assisted browser automation. This enables:

- **AI-Driven Testing**: Let AI write and execute browser tests
- **Intelligent Scraping**: AI can understand page structure and extract relevant data
- **Automated Documentation**: Generate documentation from web interfaces
- **Smart Form Filling**: AI can understand and fill complex forms

### Cursor Usage
With the MCP server configured, you can use Playwright directly in Cursor:

```
Take a screenshot of https://example.com and extract all the headings
```

The AI will automatically use the Playwright MCP server to:
1. Navigate to the URL
2. Take a screenshot
3. Extract heading elements
4. Provide structured results

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Multi-browser Support**: Firefox and Safari support
- **Mobile Testing**: Mobile device emulation
- **Performance Metrics**: Core Web Vitals monitoring
- **A/B Testing**: Automated comparison testing
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end workflow testing

### Advanced Automation
- **AI-Powered Element Detection**: Smart element finding
- **Visual Diff Testing**: Automated visual regression
- **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous performance tracking
- **Cross-browser Testing**: Multi-browser compatibility
